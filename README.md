Does that^

I removed the classes for weapons, vehicles, sig scanning, 
and the RegHookEx stuff for aimbots.  I intentionally left the 
aimbot math (all of it), and have clear documentation on how 
to use RegHookEx externally to write viewangles.

Uses some no-thrills menu class I wrote, feel free to make it 
pretty.

Don't sell it pls.

Reads complete class sizes, and even uses vsync so the overlay 
doesn't eat all of your cpu.  Regarding speeds, this is about as 
smooth and fast as an external gets.


As for screenshots, it doesn't do anything to mitigate them.  You 
can use my screenshot hooker I released on UC, I'll add a repo for 
it here as well.  The class name on the overlay is set and ready 
to be used with it.
